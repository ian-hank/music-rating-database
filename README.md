Music Rating Program
Author: Ian C. Hank
Version: 0.1
Still Updating: Yes
====================

====================
TLDR: Simple program to store the rating you have given to entered songs. 

This program will allow the user to enter specific songs they just listened to and rate them. The rating system will be different
depending on the genre. The songs can be organized and kept within a structure. The structure will be able to organize and show
lists of songs within different genres.  
====================


========ABOUT========
This was my first real project I began working on. My first project that had purpose and was not an example program to make 
online. I just wanted a simple way to store all my personal ratings of specific songs. I originally was trying to make some
thing just text based and quick for me to use with one large data structure. I think I will start with a terminal based program
and then upgrade over time. After more thought I decided to go bigger with it and improve my skills in the meantime. I will 
continue to update the program until I feel I am happy with it.
